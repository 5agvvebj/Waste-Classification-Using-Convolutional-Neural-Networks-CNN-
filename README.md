# Waste-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
This project aims to automate waste classification using deep learning models (ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG). The models are trained on labeled images to categorize waste efficiently, improving recycling and environmental sustainability.

ðŸš€ Features
Uses CNN architectures (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG) for classification.
Data preprocessing with augmentation for better generalization.
Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization of model performance using confusion matrices and loss/accuracy plots.
Potential for real-world deployment in waste management systems.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Optimize models for faster inference.
Expand dataset for better generalization.
Deploy as a web app using Flask/Django.
